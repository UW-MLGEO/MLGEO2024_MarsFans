**Mapping alluvial fans on Mars**

This repository contains instructions for analyzing images of alluvial fans and deltas on Mars's surface, mainly focusing on Eberswalde crater. We train and apply a self-supervised deep learning algorithm to segment the images of these fans.

To get started, go to the `check_training_images.ipynb` notebook. Here you will find instructions for downloading and viewing the training data
