# Mapping alluvial fans on Mars

A project for ESS 469/569 in Autumn 2024.

This repository contains instructions for analyzing images of alluvial fans and deltas on Mars's surface, mainly focusing on Eberswalde crater. We train and apply a self-supervised deep learning algorithm to segment the images of these fans.

To get started, go to the `check_training_images.ipynb` notebook to find instructions for downloading and viewing the training data.
